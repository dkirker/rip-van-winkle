It seems that The Great Suspender is not really trustworthy any more. :'( I have forked it with the intention of removing any un-trustworthy bits for my own personal use. I may, from time to time, add features. I am, however, NOT going to be maintaining this as an active project outside of my own personal use. If others do want to use it, feel free! I will also not be maintaining a Chrome Web Store version. This is a 100% compile-it-yourself project. (I suppose in that regard this also means that you know what you are getting, as the source code is all here for quick review -- as opposed to being hidden and compressed in a package deep within the bowels of your filesystem.)

Happy sleeping!

## The Great Suspender

<img src="/src/img/suspendy-guy.png" width="100px" />

"The Great Suspender" is a free and open-source Google Chrome extension for people who find that chrome is consuming too much system resource or suffer from frequent chrome crashing. Once installed and enabled, this extension will automatically *suspend* tabs that have not been used for a while, freeing up memory and cpu that the tab was consuming.

If you have suggestions or problems using the extension, please [submit a bug or a feature request](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/). For other enquiries you can email me at greatsuspender@gmail.com.

**If you have lost tabs from your browser:** I have written a guide for how to recover your lost tabs [here](https://github.com/deanoemcke/thegreatsuspender/issues/526
).

### Install as an extension from source

1. Download the **[latest available version](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/releases)** and unarchive to your preferred location (whichever suits you).
2. Using **Google Chrome** browser, navigate to chrome://extensions/ and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right corner.
3. Click on the <kbd>Load unpacked extension...</kbd> button.
4. Browse to the src directory of the unarchived folder and confirm.

If you have completed the above steps, the "welcome" page will open indicating successful installation of the extension.

Be sure to unsuspend all suspended tabs before removing any other version of the extension or they will disappear forever!

### Build from github

Dependencies: openssl, npm.

Clone the repository and run these commands:
```
npm install
npm run generate-key
npm run build
```

It should say:
```
Done, without errors.
```

The extension in crx format will be inside the build/crx/ directory. You can drag it into [extensions] (chrome://extensions) to install locally.

### Integrating with another Chrome extension or app

This extension has a small external api to allow other extensions to request the suspension of a tab. See [this issue](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/276) for more information. And please let me know about it so that I can try it out!
